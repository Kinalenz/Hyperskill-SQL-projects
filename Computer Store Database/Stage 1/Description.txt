Description
As a computer store manager, staying informed about the store's condition and the products is crucial. It's vital to gather information about expensive items, such as printers, available in limited quantities. This will help you manage inventory effectively and ensure you offer your customers the best products possible.

Identify printers in your inventory that are priced over $200;
Find the model number, type, and price of the Printer. The order of the columns matters.
Take a look at the following database structure:



Explanation of database
The Product table stores information about manufacturers (maker), model numbers (model), and product types (type). The model numbers in the Product table are unique across all manufacturers and product types.

The PC table contains information about each personal computer, identified by a unique code (pc_code). A PC model is indicated using a foreign key to the Product table (model). Other specifications include the processor speed (speed) in megahertz, memory size (ram) in megabytes, hard disk capacity (hd) in gigabytes, the CD reader speed (cd) such as DVD, and the price (price) in dollars.

The Laptop table is similar to the PC table, but instead of the CD reader speed, it includes the screen size (screen) in inches.

The Printer table provides information about each printer model, such as whether it is color (color, indicated by C for color printers and B for black printers), the printer type (type, which can be Laser for laser printers, Jet for inkjet printers, or Matrix for matrix printers), and the price (price) in dollars.
